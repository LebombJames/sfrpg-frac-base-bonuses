# SFRPG Fractional Base Bonuses

An implementation of the [Fractional Base Bonuses Variant Rule from Pathfinder Unchained](https://www.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?Name=Fractional%20Base%20Bonuses&Category=Pathfinder%20Unchained) for the Starfinder system on Foundry VTT.

This variant rule corrects some weirdness with the maths of taking levels in multiple classes, like abnormally low BAB, and abnormally high saving throws.

While the rule isn't made for Starfinder, it can be implemented seamlessly as both it and Pathfinder First Edition have the same underlying maths.
